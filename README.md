# Discovering Metallic Glasses with HiTp Experiment and Machine Learning
This repository contains scripts necessary to recreate the results from "Accelerated Discovery of Metallic Glasses through Iteration of Machine Learning and High-Throughput Experiments," a paper authored by Fang Ren, Logan Ward, Travis Williams, Kevin Laws, Chris Wolverton, Jason Hattrick-Simpers, and Apurva Mehta. 

## Running the Scripts

There are a few options for running the software in this repository.

*Option 1*: Install the software on your own machine. See directions in the [`machine-learning/README.txt`](machine-learning) for the required sofware.

*Option 2*: Use Docker. Build the container described in [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile)

*Option 3*: Use [WholeTale](https://dashboard.wholetale.org/tale/view/5ad4eb52f4b80b00018d92e1). The data and software for this study are published on [WholeTale](http://wholetale.org/), which will let you run them without installing any software.
