This directory contains a script designed to test how adding more data
changes the accuracy of our machine learning model, and a script for running
the model to find new metallic glasses.

To run the scripts call `./run_all.bs`. 

The code for comparing the performance of the model as more data is 
contained within the notebook, `compare-models.ipynb`. The new predicted
glasses are summarized in `new-glasses_P0.95_dist0.10.csv`.
