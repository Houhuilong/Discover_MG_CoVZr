Logan's To-Do List:
- Read datasets for ML from the data directory. (i.e., do not duplicate sputtering data in ML directory)
- Make ML-related (e.g., ML figure plotting scripts) Python 2 compatible
- Move ML figures to "scripts/figure_plotters" directory
- Add ML models to oqmd.org
- Compute log losses vs Co-V-Zr and Fe-Nb-Ti data
